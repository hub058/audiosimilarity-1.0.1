Score for audio and speech similarity
================================

 This project improve two parts. One is score algorithms library to audio and speech similarity, the other is project for C# call C dll library. 

algorithms information
--------------------------
*  Function: counting audio and voice similarity with audio_dsym,
*  audio_dasym and predict features (average compensation feature,
*  spectral gain_modulate feature,neteq feature and so on.)
*  Date   :2018-2-12
*  Version: v1.0.0.1

Development pattern for contributors
------------------------------------

1. [Create audiosimilarity C# project](https://github.com/makinglong/audiosimilarity-1.0.1) and add dll library.
  
2. Build and run.

Platform specific notes
-----------------------

### PowerPC 64bits

- it is expected to work out of the box in operating system >= WIN_7 and Visual Studio >= 2013.
